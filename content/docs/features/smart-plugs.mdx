# Smart Plugs

Smart plugs extend your smart home beyond lighting, allowing you to control any plugged-in device through We Love Lights. Turn lamps, fans, coffee makers, and more on or off with your Mac, switches, or automation.

## What Are Smart Plugs?

### Smart Plug Basics

Smart plugs are intelligent outlets:
- **Plug into wall**: Replace standard outlet access
- **Control power**: Turn connected devices on/off
- **Wireless**: Zigbee communication with your bridge
- **No wiring**: Simple plug and play
- **Automation ready**: Works with scenes and rules

### How Smart Plugs Work

1. **Plug into outlet**: Insert in wall socket
2. **Connect device**: Plug your device into the smart plug
3. **Pair with bridge**: Connect to your Philips Hue or Zigbee bridge
4. **Control**: Turn on/off through We Love Lights

**Important**: Smart plugs control power only - they turn the outlet on or off. The connected device must be left in the "on" position to respond.
