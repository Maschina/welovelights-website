# Scenes

Scenes are pre-configured lighting setups that you can activate with a single click. Instead of adjusting each light individually, scenes let you instantly create the perfect atmosphere for any activity or mood.

## What Are Scenes?

### Scene Basics

A scene saves the state of multiple lights:
- **Power state**: Which lights are on or off
- **Brightness**: Each light's brightness level
- **Color**: Color or temperature settings
- **Scope**: Which lights are included

When you activate a scene, all included lights immediately change to match the saved settings.

### Why Use Scenes?

**Convenience**
- One-click lighting control
- No manual adjustment needed
- Consistent results every time

**Speed**
- Faster than adjusting multiple lights
- Instant room transformation
- Perfect for routines

**Consistency**
- Reproduce exact lighting every time
- Share lighting setups across time
- Remember complex configurations

## Types of Scenes

### Room Scenes

Affect only lights in a specific room:
- **Scope**: Single room
- **Access**: Show when viewing that room
- **Use**: Room-specific moods and activities

**Examples**: "Living Room - Movie", "Bedroom - Sleep", "Kitchen - Cooking"

### Zone Scenes

Apply to specific zones within rooms:
- **Scope**: Subset of room lights
- **Access**: Show when viewing that zone
- **Use**: Area-specific lighting

**Examples**: "Kitchen Island - Dinner", "Office - Desk Only"

### Global Scenes

Affect multiple rooms or all lights:
- **Scope**: Across multiple rooms
- **Access**: Available from anywhere
- **Use**: Whole-home lighting states

**Examples**: "All Off", "Good Morning", "Away from Home", "Party Mode"

## Creating Scenes

### Method 1: Capture Current State

The easiest way - save exactly what you see:

1. **Set up your lights** manually
   - Adjust each light to desired brightness
   - Set colors or temperatures
   - Turn some on, others off as needed

2. **Open We Love Lights Studio**

3. **Create the scene**
   - Go to **Scenes** section
   - Click **"Create Scene"** or **"+" button**
   - Or use **"Save Current State as Scene"** action

4. **Configure scene details**
   - **Name**: Give it a descriptive name
   - **Scope**: Choose room, zone, or global
   - **Include**: Verify which lights are included

5. **Save**
   - Click **"Save"** or **"Create"**
   - Scene appears in your scene list

### Method 2: Build from Scratch

Create a scene without physically adjusting lights:

1. **Open Studio** → **Scenes**
2. Click **"New Scene"**
3. **Select lights** to include
4. **Set each light**:
   - Power state (on/off)
   - Brightness level
   - Color or temperature
5. **Preview** if available
6. **Save** with a name

### Method 3: Duplicate Existing Scene

Start from an existing scene:

1. Find scene to duplicate
2. Right-click and choose **"Duplicate"**
3. Modify settings as needed
4. Save with new name

## Advanced Scene Features

### Dynamic Scenes

Some scenes can be dynamic:
- **Time-based**: Change settings based on time of day
- **Sensor-triggered**: Activate based on motion or conditions
- **Randomized**: Slight variations each time

Availability depends on bridge capabilities.

### Scene Transitions

Control how scenes activate:

**Instant Transition**
- Lights change immediately
- Can be jarring
- Good for on/off scenarios

**Smooth Transition**
- Gradual fade to new settings
- More pleasant
- Takes 1-3 seconds
- Default for most scenes

**Slow Fade**
- Very gradual transition
- 5-10+ seconds
- Dramatic effect
- Good for mood changes

Set transition time in scene settings if supported.

### Scene Stacking

Apply multiple scenes:

1. Activate base scene (e.g., "Evening")
2. Activate accent scene (e.g., "Reading Light")
3. Both apply, with later scene taking priority

Useful for layered lighting effects.

### Scene Scheduling

Automate scene activation:

1. Use **Shortcuts app** with time triggers
2. Or set up **rules** in We Love Lights
3. Or use **motion sensors** to trigger scenes

See [Automation Examples](/docs/integration/automation-examples).

## Scene Best Practices

### Creating Effective Scenes

1. **Purpose-driven**: Create scenes for specific activities
2. **Test in environment**: Ensure lighting works in actual space
3. **Multiple variations**: Different intensities for same activity
4. **Name clearly**: Know what you're activating
5. **Regular review**: Delete unused, update old scenes

### Organizing Scenes

1. **Limit total count**: Too many scenes = choice paralysis
2. **Favorite frequently used**: Quick access to common scenes
3. **Logical naming**: Consistent naming convention
4. **Group by room**: Room-specific scenes easier to find
5. **Archive old scenes**: Hide rather than delete if unsure

### Performance Tips

1. **Smaller scope**: Room scenes activate faster than global
2. **Fewer lights**: Scenes with fewer lights respond quicker
3. **Local activation**: Faster than remote activation
4. **Avoid rapid switching**: Wait for scene to fully activate

## Scene Synchronization

### Syncing with Hue App

Scenes sync between We Love Lights and Philips Hue app:

- **Create in either app**: Appears in both
- **Modify in either**: Changes reflect everywhere
- **Delete in either**: Removes from both
- **Automatic sync**: Usually within seconds

### Multi-Bridge Scenes

Scenes are bridge-specific:
- Each bridge has its own scenes
- Can't directly span multiple bridges
- **Workaround**: Create same-named scenes on each bridge, activate both

## Troubleshooting Scenes

### Scene Doesn't Activate

**Problem**: Clicking scene does nothing

**Solutions**:
- Check lights are reachable and powered on
- Verify bridge connection
- Try activating individual lights
- Refresh device list
- Check scene wasn't accidentally modified

### Scene Looks Different

**Problem**: Scene doesn't look like when created

**Solutions**:
- Lights may have been manually adjusted since
- Some lights might be unreachable
- Room lighting conditions changed
- Consider recreating scene
- Check all lights in scene are still present

### Can't Create Scene

**Problem**: Create scene button doesn't work

**Solutions**:
- Check you're connected to bridge
- Verify you have lights configured
- Try refreshing from bridge
- Check bridge storage isn't full
- Restart We Love Lights

### Scene Activates Slowly

**Problem**: Long delay when activating scene

**Solutions**:
- Too many lights in scene (split into smaller scenes)
- Network congestion
- Using remote instead of local connection
- Bridge overloaded with commands

### Scene Missing After Update

**Problem**: Scene disappeared

**Solutions**:
- Check if hidden (Settings → Hidden Items)
- Verify you're viewing correct bridge
- Scene may have been deleted in other app
- Check sync with bridge (refresh)
