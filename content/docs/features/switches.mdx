# Smart Switches

Smart switches (also called remotes or dimmers) are physical buttons that control your lights without opening an app. We Love Lights provides powerful configuration options for Philips Hue switches and compatible Zigbee button devices.

## What Are Smart Switches?

### Switch Basics

Smart switches are wireless button devices:
- **Physical buttons**: Tactile control without phone/computer
- **Wireless**: Zigbee communication, no wiring needed
- **Battery powered**: Place anywhere
- **Programmable**: Customize what each button does
- **Multi-function**: Single press, long press, different actions

### Why Use Switches?

**Convenience**
- Physical control without devices
- Instant access on wall or table
- Works when phone/computer isn't nearby

**Family-Friendly**

- Press 3: "Nightlight" (very dim)
- Press 4: Off

**Kitchen Switch**
- Press 1: "Cooking" (bright task)
- Press 2: "Dining" (warm medium)
- Press 3: "Ambient" (dim accent)

## Generic Button Patterns

Create advanced custom button behaviors.

### Custom Pattern Structure

1. **Trigger**: Which button and press type
2. **Conditions**: When to execute (optional)
   - Time of day
   - Current light state
   - Other device states
3. **Actions**: What to do
   - Multiple actions possible
   - Execute in sequence
4. **Advanced logic**: If/then conditions

### Advanced Examples

**Context-Aware On Button**
- If lights are off → Turn on to "Morning" scene (if before noon) or "Evening" scene (if after)
- If lights are on → Cycle through 3 brightness levels

**Multi-Room Control**
- Single press → Control current room
- Long press → Control multiple rooms
- Double press → All off

**Scene Memory**
- On button → Recall last used scene
- Off button → Turn off and remember current scene

## Switch Rules vs Scenes

### When to Use Switch Rules

Best for:
- Dynamic behavior (changes based on conditions)
- Complex multi-step actions
- Controlling multiple rooms differently
- Time-based behaviors

### When to Use Scenes

Best for:
- Simple, consistent lighting states
- Single room control
- Specific light configurations
- When you want same result every time

### Combining Both

Most effective: Use scenes triggered by switches:
1. Create scenes for desired states
2. Configure switch to activate those scenes
3. Easy to modify scenes without reconfiguring switch

## Multi-Button Combinations

Some switches support detecting multiple simultaneous presses.

### Combination Patterns

**Two Button Press**
- Press buttons 1+2 together → Special action
- Press buttons 3+4 together → Different action

**All Buttons**
- Press all buttons → Emergency all-off
- Press all buttons long → Reset configuration

Availability depends on switch model and firmware.

## Switch Placement Tips

### Physical Installation

**Wall Mounting**
- Use included mount/adhesive
- Place at comfortable height (standard switch height)
- Near doorways for easy access
- Consider 3M Command strips for renter-friendly installation

**Portable Placement**
- Nightstand: Bedside control

Switch reconnects automatically; configuration preserved.

## Testing Switch Configuration

### Test Your Setup

After configuring, test thoroughly:

1. **Press each button**:
   - Verify expected action occurs
   - Check all press types (single, long)
2. **Test edge cases**:
   - What if lights already on/off?
   - Behavior at different times of day?
3. **Test range**:
   - Works from intended location?
   - No missed presses?
4. **Adjust as needed**:
   - Tweak brightness levels
   - Change scene selections
   - Modify timing

### Common Adjustments

After testing:
- **Brightness too high/low**: Adjust scene brightness
- **Wrong scene order**: Reorder cycle sequence
- **Button feels wrong**: Swap button assignments
- **Need more options**: Add more scenes to cycle

## Troubleshooting Switches

### Button Press Not Working

**Problem**: Pressing button does nothing

**Solutions**:
- Check battery level (replace if low)
- Verify switch is in range of bridge
- Check if button is configured (not set to "do nothing")
- Try pressing more firmly
- Verify lights are reachable and powered on
- Check bridge connection

### Wrong Action Happens

**Problem**: Button does something unexpected

**Solutions**:
- Review button configuration in Studio
- Check if multiple rules assigned to button
- Verify correct press type (single vs long)
- Reset switch configuration and reconfigure
- Check for conflicting automation rules

### Delayed Response

**Problem**: Lights respond slowly to button press

**Solutions**:
- Normal delay: 0.5-1 second (processing time)
- Check network/bridge connection quality
- Verify switch battery isn't low
- Reduce number of lights controlled by button
- Check bridge isn't overloaded

### Switch Not Detected

**Problem**: Switch doesn't appear in We Love Lights

**Solutions**:
- Verify switch is connected to bridge (check Hue app)
- Press reset button on switch (usually inside battery compartment)
- Re-pair switch with bridge
- Refresh device list in We Love Lights
- Restart We Love Lights

### Button Only Works Sometimes

**Problem**: Inconsistent button response

**Solutions**:
- Check battery level (weak battery causes issues)
- Verify switch is in range of bridge
- Check for physical obstructions
- Ensure switch is mounted securely (loose mount causes poor contact)
- Replace battery even if level shows okay

### Configuration Lost

**Problem**: Switch reverts to default behavior

**Solutions**:
- Switch may have been reset accidentally
- Check if configuration was saved properly
- Verify bridge firmware is up to date
- Reconfigure and test immediately
- Check for bridge resets or power issues

## Advanced Switch Features

### Switch Linking

Some configurations allow linking switches:

**Master/Slave Setup**
- One switch controls multiple rooms
- Synchronized switch behavior
- Useful for multi-room control

**Group Switching**
- Multiple switches control same lights
- 3-way switch simulation
- Different switches, different locations

### Conditional Switching

Switch behavior changes based on conditions:

**Time-Based**
- Morning: Button activates "Wake Up" scene
- Evening: Same button activates "Relax" scene

**State-Based**
- If lights off: Turn on to preset
- If lights on: Cycle brightness
- If already bright: Turn off

### Switch Macros

Execute multiple actions from one button:

**Example Macro**
- Turn on living room lights (60%)
- Turn on kitchen lights (40%)
- Turn off bedroom lights
- Activate "Evening" scene in dining room

All from single button press!

## Best Practices

### Configuration Tips

1. **Keep it simple**: Don't overcomplicate button actions
2. **Consistent patterns**: Use similar logic across switches
3. **Test with family**: Ensure others understand buttons
4. **Label switches**: Use provided stickers or make custom
5. **Document**: Note configuration for future reference

### Placement Strategy

1. **High traffic**: Switches in frequently used locations
2. **Redundancy**: Multiple ways to control important lights
3. **Guest access**: At least one switch in guest areas
4. **Bedside**: Always have switch within reach of bed
5. **Entrance**: Control lights before entering dark room

### Maintenance

1. **Monitor battery**: Replace before completely dead
2. **Clean regularly**: Dust can interfere with presses
3. **Test periodically**: Ensure configuration still works
4. **Update firmware**: Keep switch firmware current
5. **Spare batteries**: Keep replacements on hand
