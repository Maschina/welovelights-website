## Tips for Perfect Lighting

### Color Selection Tips

1. **Start with temperature**: Try whites before full color
2. **Use CIE for accuracy**: Most precise color representation
3. **Consider bulb limits**: Not all colors possible on all bulbs
4. **Test in environment**: Colors look different in different rooms
5. **Save as scenes**: Don't repeatedly adjust manually

### Brightness Tips

1. **Lower than you think**: 50% often looks like 100%
2. **Time of day matters**: Adjust for natural light levels
3. **Task-specific**: Reading needs more than relaxing
4. **Multiple levels**: Don't just use on/off
5. **Gradual changes**: Slow transitions are less jarring

### Performance Tips

1. **Batch changes**: Adjust multiple lights at once
2. **Use groups**: Faster than individual control
3. **Scenes over manual**: Pre-configure common settings
4. **Transition time**: Shorter = slightly more responsive
5. **Local connection**: Faster than remote

### Creative Lighting Ideas

1. **Accent colors**: Use color lights for ambient accents
2. **Temperature by time**: Warm evening, cool daytime
3. **Match content**: Sync with movies, music, games
4. **Seasonal themes**: Change colors by season or holiday
5. **Activity-based**: Different settings for different activities

## Troubleshooting

### Color Doesn't Look Right

**Problem**: Color appears different than expected

**Solutions**:
- Different bulb models have different gamuts
- Use CIE picker to see light's capabilities
- Check bulb actually supports color (not just white)
- Try different color picker method
- Consider room lighting and wall colors

### Brightness Won't Go Low Enough

**Problem**: Light too bright even at 1%

**Solutions**:
- This is a bulb limitation (different minimum per model)
- Use scenes with multiple lights for lower ambient
- Cover lamp partially if needed
- Consider using fewer lights

### Changes Are Slow

**Problem**: Color/brightness changes take too long

**Solutions**:
- Check network connection quality
- Reduce number of lights changed simultaneously
- Use local connection instead of remote
- Check bridge isn't overloaded with commands

### Can't Select Specific Color

**Problem**: Can't get exact color desired

**Solutions**:
- Color may be outside bulb's gamut (use CIE picker to see limits)
- Try different color picker (RGB for exact values)
- Some colors impossible for any light (very pure colors)
- Check bulb supports full color (not just white ambiance)
