# Demo Mode

Demo Mode allows you to explore and test We Love Lights without requiring a physical Philips Hue or deCONZ bridge. It's perfect for trying the app before purchasing hardware, development testing, or learning the interface.

## What is Demo Mode?

### Demo Mode Overview

Demo Mode creates a virtual bridge with simulated devices:
- **No hardware required**: Works without physical bridge

- **Safe testing**: No impact on real setup

### When to Use Demo Mode

**Before Purchase**:
- Evaluate We Love Lights features
- Test compatibility with workflow
- Learn the interface
- Decide if it meets your needs

**Development**:
- Test configurations without hardware
- Try new automations safely
- Learn advanced features
- Training and demonstrations

**Learning**:
- Practice without affecting real lights
- Experiment with rules and scenes
- Try different organizations
- Explore all features

**Troubleshooting**:
- Isolate app issues from hardware issues
- Test specific scenarios
- Verify expected behavior

## Enabling Demo Mode

### Activation Steps

1. **Open We Love Lights Studio**
2. Go to **Preferences** or **Settings** (⌘ + ,)
3. Find **"Demo Mode"** or **"Development"** section
4. Click **"Enable Demo Mode"** or similar
5. Confirm activation
6. Demo bridge appears in bridge selector

### What Gets Created

When you enable Demo Mode:

**Virtual Bridge**:
- Named "Demo Bridge" or similar
- Appears alongside real bridges
- Full feature set available

**Sample Devices**:

- Saves manual work

Note: Not all configurations transfer automatically.

### Disabling Demo Mode

When you're done with demo:

1. **Go to Preferences**
2. Find **Demo Mode** settings
3. Click **"Disable Demo Mode"**
4. Confirm
5. Demo bridge disappears

**Impact**:
- Demo bridge removed
- Real bridges unaffected
- Demo configurations lost
