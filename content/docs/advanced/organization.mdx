# Organization

A well-organized smart home is easier to control, faster to navigate, and simpler to maintain. This guide covers advanced organization techniques in We Love Lights to keep your setup clean and efficient.

## Naming Strategies

### Device Naming Best Practices

Clear, consistent names make everything easier.

#### Location-Based Naming

**Format**: `Room - Location/Function`

**Examples**:
- "Kitchen - Island Left"
- "Kitchen - Island Right"
- "Living Room - Floor Lamp"
- "Bedroom - Nightstand Right"
- "Bathroom - Mirror"

**Benefits**:
- Easy to find devices by location
- Clear which light is which
- Scales well with large setups

#### Function-Based Naming

**Format**: `Room - Purpose`

**Examples**:
- "Office - Desk Light"
- "Bedroom - Reading Lamp"
- "Living Room - Accent Light"
- "Kitchen - Task Lighting"

**Benefits**:
- Understand purpose at a glance
- Easier voice control descriptions
- Intuitive for guests

#### Combined Approach

**Format**: `Room - Location - Type`

**Examples**:
- "Master Bedroom - Left Nightstand - Lamp"
- "Kitchen - Under Cabinet - Strip"
- "Garage - Ceiling - Bulb 1"

**Benefits**:
- Most specific
- No ambiguity
- Best for very large setups

### Naming Conventions

**Consistency is Key**:
- Choose one format and stick to it
- All devices follow same pattern
- Makes searching easier

**Avoid**:
- ❌ Generic: "Light 1", "Bulb A"
- ❌ Vague: "That one", "The main light"
- ❌ Technical: "Hue Color A19 #3"
- ❌ Mixed styles: "kitchen light" + "Bedroom Lamp" + "LIV_ROOM_1"

**Good Practices**:
- ✅ Descriptive
- ✅ Consistent capitalization
- ✅ Clear room indication
- ✅ Unique per device

## Room and Group Organization

### Creating Logical Rooms

**Standard Rooms**:
- Living Room
- Kitchen
- Dining Room
- Bedrooms (numbered if multiple)
- Bathrooms (numbered if multiple)
- Hallways
- Garage
- Outdoor

**Specific Naming for Multiple**:
- "Master Bedroom" vs "Bedroom 2"
- "Main Bathroom" vs "Guest Bathroom"
- "Front Hallway" vs "Upstairs Hallway"

### Zone Strategy

Use zones for room subsections:

**Large Rooms**:
- "Kitchen - Island"
- "Kitchen - Dining Area"
- "Kitchen - Counter"

**Flexible Spaces**:
- "Living Room - TV Area"
- "Living Room - Reading Nook"
- "Living Room - Accent"

**Multi-Purpose Rooms**:
- "Basement - Workshop"
- "Basement - Media"
- "Basement - Storage"

### Custom Groups

Beyond rooms and zones, create functional groups:

**Activity-Based**:
- "Movie Lights" - All lights used during movies
- "Work Lights" - Lights on during work hours
- "Path Lights" - Lights for nighttime navigation
- "Party Lights" - Color lights for celebrations

**Floor/Area-Based**:
- "First Floor"
- "Second Floor"
- "Basement"
- "Outdoor"

**Automation Groups**:
- "Motion Controlled" - All motion sensor lights
- "Always On" - Security or essential lights
- "Seasonal" - Holiday or seasonal decorations

## Visual Organization

### Reordering Items

Drag and drop to organize:

**Studio Sidebar**:
1. Click and hold item
2. Drag to desired position
3. Drop to place
4. Order saved automatically

**Strategic Ordering**:
- **Most used first**: Quick access
- **By location**: Room-by-room tour
- **By function**: All sensors together, all switches together
- **By frequency**: Daily use at top, rarely used at bottom

### Hiding Unused Items

Clean up interface by hiding:

**What to Hide**:
- Seasonal devices (off-season)
- Spare/replacement devices
- Rarely accessed items
- Decommissioned devices (before deleting)

**How to Hide**:
1. Right-click device/group
2. Select **"Hide"**
3. Item disappears from lists

**Unhiding**:
1. **Settings** → **Hidden Items**
2. Find item
3. Click **"Show"** or **"Unhide"**

**Benefits**:
- Cleaner interface
- Faster navigation
- Less scrolling
- Focus on what you use

### Favorites System

Mark frequently used items:

**What to Favorite**:
- Most-used rooms
- Go-to scenes
- Primary control lights
- Frequently accessed devices

**How to Favorite**:
1. Hover over item
2. Click **star icon**
3. Or right-click → **"Add to Favorites"**

**Favorite Display**:
- Appear at top of sections
- Quick access in menu bar
- Priority in search results

**Don't Over-Favorite**:
- Too many favorites = no favorites
- Only mark truly frequent items
- Review and remove periodically

## Search and Filter

### Effective Searching

**Search Bar Usage**:
- **Partial names**: "liv" finds "Living Room"
- **Multiple words**: Searches all terms
- **Case insensitive**: Lowercase works
- **Device types**: "sensor" finds all sensors

**Search Tips**:
1. Use distinctive parts of names
2. Search by room name
3. Search by device type
4. Search by function ("reading", "desk")

### Filtering

**By Type**:
- Lights only
- Sensors only
- Switches only
- Scenes only
- Smart plugs only

**By Status**:
- On devices
- Off devices
- Unreachable devices
- Low battery devices

**By Room**:
- All devices in specific room
- Cross-room searches
- Room hierarchies

### Saved Searches

If supported:
- Save frequent search queries
- Quick access to complex filters
- Named search views

## Documentation

### Internal Documentation

**Device Notes**:
- Add notes to devices (if supported)
- Document location details
- Note special behaviors
- Record purchase dates

**Scene Descriptions**:
- What the scene does
- When to use it
- Which rooms it affects

**Rule Documentation**:
- Why rule exists
- Expected behavior
- Last modified date
- Who created it

### External Documentation

Keep separate records:

**Spreadsheet/Document**:
- All devices and locations
- Bridge assignments
- Purchase dates and warranties
- Replacement schedule (bulbs, batteries)
- Configuration notes

**Diagram**:
- Floor plan with device locations
- Sensor coverage areas
- Bridge placement and ranges
- Zigbee mesh visualization

**Change Log**:
- Date of changes
- What was changed
- Why it was changed

**Solutions**:
- Use search function
- Check hidden items
- Try "Identify" feature (makes light blink)
- Review device info for clues
- Check alternative names

### Interface Feels Cluttered

**Problem**: Too many items visible

**Solutions**:
- Hide rarely used items
- Remove unused devices
- Limit favorites
- Use groups more
- Simplify room structure

### Inconsistent Naming

**Problem**: Names don't follow pattern

**Solutions**:
- Decide on naming convention
- Systematically rename all devices
- Document the standard
- Stick to it going forward

### Lost Track of Setup

**Problem**: Don't remember configuration

**Solutions**:
- Review device by device
- Check rule configurations
- Look at scene setups
- Consult old documentation
- Start fresh documentation now

## Organization Tools

### Batch Operations

If supported, batch rename or organize:
- Select multiple devices
- Apply same change to all
- Faster than one-by-one

### Templates

Create templates for new devices:
- Naming templates
- Scene templates
- Rule templates
- Apply to new devices quickly

### Backup and Restore

**Backup Configuration**:
