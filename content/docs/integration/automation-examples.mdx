**Implementation**: macOS Shortcuts

**Setup**:
1. Create three scenes:
   - "Wake Start": 5% warm white
   - "Wake Mid": 30% neutral white
   - "Wake Full": 80% cool white

2. Create Shortcut "Wake Up":
   - **7:00 AM**: Activate "Wake Start"
   - **Wait 5 minutes**
   - **7:05 AM**: Activate "Wake Mid"
   - **Wait 10 minutes**
   - **7:15 AM**: Activate "Wake Full"

3. Set automation trigger for 7:00 AM weekdays

**Customization**:
- Adjust timing for your schedule
- Change color temperatures to preference
- Add coffee maker (smart plug) at final step

### Weekend vs Weekday Mornings

**Scenario**: Different routines for workdays and weekends.

**Implementation**: Shortcuts with conditionals

**Setup**:
1. Create Shortcut "Morning Routine":
   ```
   Get Day of Week
   If day is Monday-Friday
       Activate Scene "Work Morning" (bright, energizing)
       Wait 30 minutes
       Activate Scene "Focus Mode"
   Otherwise (Weekend)
       Activate Scene "Relaxed Morning" (warm, gentle)
   End If
   ```

2. Trigger at same time every day
3. Logic handles the difference

**Benefits**:
- Single shortcut to maintain
- Appropriate lighting for context
- Can add more weekend-specific actions

## Evening and Bedtime

### Sunset-Triggered Evening Mode

**Scenario**: Automatically shift to evening lighting at sunset.

**Implementation**: Shortcuts + Time trigger

**Setup**:
1. Create scene "Evening Ambiance" (warm, medium brightness)

2. Create automation:
   - **Trigger**: Sunset time (or fixed time like 6 PM)
   - **Action**: Activate "Evening Ambiance"

3. macOS Shortcuts can use sunset time if configured with location

**Alternative**: Fixed time trigger (6-7 PM) if sunset automation unavailable

### Progressive Bedtime Dimming

**Scenario**: Gradually dim lights leading to bedtime.

**Implementation**: Multiple Shortcuts or single complex one

**Setup**:
1. Create scenes:
   - "Evening" (60% warm)
   - "Pre-Bed" (30% warm)
   - "Bedtime" (10% very warm/amber)

2. Set automations:
   - **9:00 PM**: "Evening"
   - **10:00 PM**: "Pre-Bed"
   - **10:30 PM**: "Bedtime"

**Advanced**: Single shortcut with delays (may be interrupted if Mac sleeps)

### Goodnight Routine

**Scenario**: One command to prepare house for sleep.

**Implementation**: Scene + Shortcut + Voice command

**Setup**:
1. Create Shortcut "Good Night":
   - Turn off all lights except bedroom
   - Activate "Bedroom Nightlight" (2% warm)
   - Turn on bedroom fan (smart plug)
   - Turn off entertainment devices (smart plugs)

2. Add Siri phrase: "Good Night"

3. Trigger:
   - Voice: "Hey Siri, good night"
   - Physical: Bedside switch long-press
   - Manual: Click shortcut

**Result**: Complete house shutdown with one command

## Motion-Based Automation

### Smart Hallway Lighting

**Scenario**: Lights turn on when entering dark hallway.

**Implementation**: Motion sensor rules (native to bridge)

**Setup**:
1. Place motion sensor in hallway

2. Configure time-based rules:

   **Daytime (6 AM - 10 PM)**:
   - Trigger: Motion
   - Condition: Light level < 50 lux
   - Action: Turn on 60% neutral
   - Timeout: 2 minutes

   **Nighttime (10 PM - 6 AM)**:
   - Trigger: Motion
   - Condition: Always
   - Action: Turn on 5% warm amber
   - Timeout: 3 minutes

**Customization**:
- Adjust lux thresholds for your hallway
- Change nighttime brightness to preference
- Longer timeout if needed

### Bathroom Night Mode

**Scenario**: Bathroom light adapts to time of day automatically.

**Implementation**: Motion sensor with time-based rules

**Setup**:
1. Motion sensor in bathroom

2. Rules:

   **Day (6 AM - 9 PM)**:
   - Motion: Turn on 80% cool white
   - Condition: Light < 100 lux
   - Timeout: 5 minutes

   **Night (9 PM - 6 AM)**:
   - Motion: Turn on 10% red or warm amber
   - Condition: Always
   - Timeout: 3 minutes

**Why it works**:
- Day: Bright task lighting when needed
