# Shortcuts App Integration

We Love Lights integrates with macOS Shortcuts (formerly Automator actions) using App Intents, allowing you to create powerful automations, voice commands with Siri, and complex workflows that combine lighting control with other apps and services.

## What is Shortcuts Integration?

### Overview

Shortcuts is Apple's automation framework:
- **Pre-installed**: Available on all modern Macs
- **Visual programming**: No code required
- **Cross-platform**: Works on Mac, iPhone, iPad
- **Siri integration**: Voice-activated shortcuts
- **Automation triggers**: Time, location, app-based

**We Love Lights + Shortcuts** = Powerful lighting automation beyond what the bridge alone can do.

### What You Can Do

**Time-Based Automation**:
- Turn on lights at specific times
- Scene changes throughout the day
- Wake-up lighting routines
- Bedtime automation

**Location-Based**:
- Activate scenes when arriving home
- Turn off lights when leaving
- Different lighting based on location

**App Integration**:
- Dim lights when video call starts
- Brighten when opening work apps
- Turn on focus lighting with Focus modes
- Integration with Calendar, Reminders, etc.

**Voice Control**:
- "Hey Siri, activate movie mode"
- "Hey Siri, turn off all lights"
- "Hey Siri, set bedroom to 50%"

## Conditional Logic

### Time-Based Conditions

Different actions based on time:

```
Get Current Time
If time is between 6 AM and 9 AM
    Activate Scene "Morning"
Otherwise if time is between 9 AM and 6 PM
    Activate Scene "Daytime"
Otherwise if time is between 6 PM and 11 PM
    Activate Scene "Evening"
Otherwise
    Activate Scene "Night"
End If
```

### State-Based Conditions

Check light state before acting:

```
Get Light State: Living Room
If Living Room is On
    Set Brightness: Living Room to 100%
Otherwise
    Turn On: Living Room to 60%
End If
```

### Complex Conditions

Multiple conditions combined:

```
Get Current Time
Get Day of Week

If (time is after 6 PM) AND (day is weekday)
    Activate Scene "Evening Workday"
Otherwise if (time is after 6 PM) AND (day is weekend)
    Activate Scene "Evening Relaxation"
Otherwise
    Activate Scene "Daytime"
End If
```

## Tips for Effective Shortcuts

### Best Practices

**Start Simple**:
- Begin with basic shortcuts
- Add complexity gradually
- Test each addition

**Name Clearly**:
- Descriptive shortcut names
- "Morning Routine" not "Shortcut 1"
- Include trigger context in name

**Test Thoroughly**:
- Test all conditions
- Try edge cases
- Verify on different days/times
- Check error handling

**Use Comments**:
- Add comments to explain logic
- Note why something is done
- Document complex conditions

**Version Control**:
- Duplicate before major changes
- Name versions: "Good Morning v1", "Good Morning v2"
- Keep working backup

### Performance Tips

**Minimize Actions**:
- Fewer actions = faster execution
- Combine where possible

**Avoid Long Waits**:
- Long delays can cause timeouts
- Consider separate shortcuts for delayed actions

**Handle Errors**:
- Add error checking
- Provide fallbacks
- User notifications for failures

### Maintenance

**Regular Review**:
- Test shortcuts monthly
- Update when life changes (seasons, routines)
- Remove unused shortcuts

**Update After Changes**:
- When you change scenes, update shortcuts using them
- When bridges change, verify bridge selections
- When moving/renaming devices, check shortcuts

## Troubleshooting Shortcuts

### Shortcut Doesn't Run

**Problem**: Shortcut fails to execute

**Solutions**:
- Check We Love Lights is running
- Verify bridge connection
- Test shortcut manually first
- Check automation permissions in System Settings
- Review error messages

### Automation Doesn't Trigger

**Problem**: Time/location trigger doesn't work

**Solutions**:
- Check automation is enabled
- Verify trigger conditions correct
- Check System Settings → Privacy → Automation
- Ensure "Run Immediately" enabled (no notification)
- Test by manually running shortcut

### Siri Doesn't Recognize

**Problem**: "Hey Siri" doesn't trigger shortcut

**Solutions**:
- Check shortcut has Siri phrase assigned
- Try rewording phrase
- Check Siri is enabled
- Verify microphone permissions
- Try re-recording phrase

### Wrong Action Occurs

**Problem**: Shortcut does unexpected thing

**Solutions**:
- Review shortcut logic carefully
- Check conditional branches
- Verify bridge and scene selections
- Test step-by-step
- Check for variable errors

### Shortcut Works Sometimes

**Problem**: Inconsistent execution

**Solutions**:
- Check conditions (time, state, etc.)
- Verify network/bridge stability
- Check if certain conditions prevent execution
- Review logs if available
- Simplify and rebuild

## Advanced Topics

### Variables and Logic

**Store values**:
```
Set Variable "OriginalBrightness" to Current Brightness
Change lights
Later: Restore to "OriginalBrightness"
```

**Calculations**:
```
Get Current Brightness
Calculate: Current Brightness + 20
Set New Brightness
```

### Repeat Loops

**Gradually brighten**:
```
Repeat 10 times
    Get Current Brightness
    Add 10%
    Set New Brightness
    Wait 30 seconds
End Repeat
```

### Input Parameters

**Create shortcuts that ask for input**:
```
Ask: "Which scene?"
Activate Scene: [User Input]
```

**Number input**:
```
Ask: "What brightness?" (Expect Number)
Set Brightness to Input
```
