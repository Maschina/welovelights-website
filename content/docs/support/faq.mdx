## General Questions

### What is We Love Lights?

We Love Lights is a premium macOS application for controlling Philips Hue and Zigbee smart lighting. It provides both a convenient menu bar app for quick access and a powerful Studio window for advanced management and automation.

### What makes We Love Lights different from the Hue app?

**Native macOS Experience**: Built specifically for Mac with SwiftUI, following Apple's design guidelines.

**Dual Interface**: Choose between menu bar for quick control or Studio for advanced features.

**Advanced Features**:
- Multi-bridge support
- Powerful rules engine
- Extensive customization
- Keyboard shortcuts
- macOS Shortcuts integration

**Professional Tools**: Drag-and-drop organization, advanced color pickers, comprehensive automation.

### Do I need a Philips Hue Bridge?

**Yes**, you need a compatible bridge:
- **Philips Hue Bridge** (most common)
- **Phoscon deCONZ Bridge** (e.g., ConBee USB stick)

We Love Lights doesn't work with Bluetooth-only Hue devices. You must have a bridge.

### Can I use it with my iPhone/iPad?

No, We Love Lights is Mac-only. However, you can use:
- Official Philips Hue mobile app on iPhone/iPad
- Both apps work with the same bridge
- Changes sync between apps

### Is there a free trial?

Check the Mac App Store listing. Many apps offer a trial period or money-back guarantee through Apple's policies. Features are not limited in a trial if available.

## Compatibility Questions

### What macOS version do I need?

**macOS 12.0 (Monterey) or later** is required.

Compatible with:
- macOS 12 Monterey
- macOS 13 Ventura
- macOS 14 Sonoma
- macOS 15 Sequoia
- Future versions (generally)

### Does it work on Apple Silicon (M1/M2/M3/M4)?

**Yes**, We Love Lights is a Universal Binary that runs natively on both:

See [Supported Devices](/docs/reference/supported-devices) for comprehensive list.

### Can I connect multiple bridges?

**Yes!** We Love Lights supports multiple bridges simultaneously. Control multiple Philips Hue bridges, deCONZ bridges, or a combination. See [Multi-Bridge Setup](/docs/advanced/multi-bridge).

### Does it work with Zigbee devices from other brands?

**Yes**, if they're connected to your bridge. We Love Lights controls devices through the bridge, so any Zigbee device your bridge supports will work. Compatibility depends on your bridge (deCONZ supports wider range).
