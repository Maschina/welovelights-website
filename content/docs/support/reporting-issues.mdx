# Reporting Issues

Encountered a bug or need help? This guide explains how to report issues effectively to get the best assistance.

## Before Reporting

### Check Existing Resources

Before submitting a report, check if your issue is already addressed:

1. **[Troubleshooting Guide](/docs/support/troubleshooting)** - Common problems and solutions
2. **[FAQ](/docs/support/faq)** - Frequently asked questions
3. **Documentation** - Feature-specific guides
4. **Recent updates** - Check if recent update addresses issue

### Try Basic Troubleshooting

Attempt these quick fixes:

**Restart Components**:
- Restart We Love Lights
- Power cycle bridge
- Restart Mac (if needed)

**Check Connections**:
- Bridge online and connected?
- Network working properly?
- Mac connected to correct network?

**Verify Setup**:
- Using latest version of We Love Lights?
- macOS up to date?
- Bridge firmware current?

If issue persists after basic troubleshooting, proceed with reporting.

## Using the Built-In Bug Reporter

We Love Lights includes an integrated bug reporting system.

### Accessing Bug Reporter

1. **Open Studio** window
2. Go to **Help** menu (or similar location in menubar)
3. Select **"Report Bug"** or **"Send Feedback"**
4. Bug reporter window opens

### What to Include

The bug reporter will prompt you for:

**Required Information**:
- **Description**: What happened?
- **Expected behavior**: What should have happened?
- **Steps to reproduce**: How can we recreate the issue?
- **Frequency**: Always, sometimes, once?

**System Information** (usually auto-filled):
- macOS version
- We Love Lights version
- Mac model and specs

**Optional but Helpful**:
- Screenshots or screen recordings
- Logs (usually attached automatically)
- Bridge type and firmware version
- Number of devices on bridge

### Writing a Good Description

**Be Specific**:
- ❌ Bad: "Lights don't work"
- ✅ Good: "Living Room lights don't respond when clicking on/off button in menu bar, but work fine in Studio"

**Include Context**:
- What were you doing when issue occurred?
- Did it work before? What changed?
- Does it happen with all devices or specific ones?

**Steps to Reproduce**:
```
1. Open We Love Lights menu bar
2. Click "Living Room"
3. Click brightness slider
4. Observe: Slider moves but lights don't change brightness
5. Expected: Lights should adjust to slider position
```

## Attaching Logs

Logs help developers diagnose issues.

### Automatic Log Attachment

Bug reporter usually attaches logs automatically:
- Recent application logs
- Crash reports if applicable
- System information

### Manual Log Collection

If needed to manually collect logs:

1. **Find Logs**:
   - `~/Library/Logs/We Love Lights/` (typical location)
   - Or through app's Help menu

2. **What to Include**:
   - Recent log files (last few days)
   - Crash reports if applicable
   - Don't edit or modify logs

3. **Attach**:
   - Drag into bug reporter
   - Or zip and attach via email if reporting externally

**Privacy Note**: Logs may contain device names and network info but should not contain passwords.

## Screenshots and Screen Recordings

Visual evidence helps tremendously.

### When to Include Screenshots

**Always helpful for**:
- UI issues (layout, display problems)
- Error messages
- Unexpected behavior
- Configuration questions

### Taking Screenshots

**Full Window**:
- ⌘ + Shift + 4, then Space, click window

**Specific Area**:
- ⌘ + Shift + 4, drag to select area

**Entire Screen**:
- ⌘ + Shift + 3

### Screen Recordings

For complex or intermittent issues:

**macOS Built-in**:
- ⌘ + Shift + 5 → Record selected portion
- Start recording, reproduce issue, stop

**QuickTime**:
- Open QuickTime Player
- File → New Screen Recording
- Record issue reproduction

**Keep it short**:
- Show just the problem
- 30-60 seconds ideal
- Narrate if helpful

## Feature Requests

Requesting new features or enhancements.

### How to Request Features

Use the same bug reporter or designated feature request channel:

**Include**:
1. **Feature description**: What do you want?
2. **Use case**: Why do you need it?
3. **Current workaround**: How do you handle it now (if at all)?
4. **Priority**: How important is this to you?

**Example**:
```
Feature: Scene scheduling within We Love Lights

Use case: I want to schedule scenes to activate at specific 
times without using Shortcuts app. Built-in scheduling would 
be more reliable and easier to manage.

Current workaround: Using macOS Shortcuts, but it's complex 
and sometimes doesn't trigger reliably.

Priority: Would significantly improve my workflow. Use 
scheduling multiple times daily.
```

### Setting Expectations

**Remember**:
- Not all requests can be implemented
- Development priorities vary
- Some features may come in future updates
- Feedback helps shape roadmap

## Sensitive Information

### What NOT to Include

- API keys or tokens
- Personal identifying information (beyond what's necessary)
- Credit card or payment info

**Be Careful With**:

- Location information

### Privacy Protection

If logs contain sensitive info:
- Rename devices temporarily
