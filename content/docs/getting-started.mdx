## Initial Setup Steps

### Step 1: Connect Your Bridge

Before you can control any devices, you need to connect We Love Lights to your bridge.

1. Click the **We Love Lights icon** in your menu bar

### Step 2: Authenticate

Once your bridge is found, you'll need to authenticate:

2. Go to your physical bridge and **press the round button** on top
3. Return to your Mac - the app will automatically connect
4. Authentication is now complete!

Your credentials are securely stored in your Mac's Keychain.

### Step 3: Discover Devices

After authentication, We Love Lights will automatically:
- Discover all lights connected to your bridge
- Import rooms and zones you've created in the Hue app
- Load existing scenes

This process usually takes just a few seconds.
