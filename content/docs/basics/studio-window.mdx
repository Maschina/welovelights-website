## Tips for Efficient Studio Use

### Power User Tips

3. **Favorite system**: Mark most-used items as favorites
4. **Regular cleanup**: Periodically review and hide unused items

### Performance Optimization

1. **Close when not needed**: Menu bar is lighter weight
2. **Refresh sparingly**: Only refresh when needed
