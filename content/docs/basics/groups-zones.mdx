# Groups & Zones

Groups allow you to control multiple lights simultaneously, making it easy to manage entire rooms or specific areas. We Love Lights works with your existing Hue rooms and zones, and lets you create custom groups for your specific needs.

## Understanding Groups

### What Are Groups?

Groups are collections of lights that can be controlled as a single unit. When you adjust a group's brightness or color, all lights in the group change together.

### Group Types

We Love Lights recognizes three types of groups:

#### Rooms
- **Physical rooms** in your home (e.g., "Living Room", "Bedroom")
- Created in the Philips Hue app or directly in We Love Lights
- Most common group type
- Each light typically belongs to one primary room

#### Zones
- **Sections or areas** within rooms (e.g., "Kitchen Island", "Reading Corner")
- Useful for larger rooms with distinct areas
- Lights can be in multiple zones
- More granular control than full rooms

#### Custom Groups
- **User-created groups** for any purpose
- Can span multiple rooms
- Perfect for lighting scenarios (e.g., "All Downstairs", "Movie Lights")
- Completely flexible organization

Zones are useful for:

## Managing Groups

### Renaming Groups

Change a group's name:

1. Select group in **Studio**
2. Click the **group name** field
3. Type new name
4. Press **Enter** to save

Names sync with your bridge and appear in other apps.

### Adding Lights to Groups

Add more lights to an existing group:

1. Select the group in **Studio**
2. Click **"Edit Group"** or **"Manage Lights"**
3. Check additional lights to include
4. Save changes

### Removing Lights from Groups

Remove lights that no longer belong:

1. Select group in **Studio**
2. Open **group editor** or **member list**
3. Uncheck lights to remove
4. Save changes

Note: Removing a light from a room may require assigning it to another room (Hue requirement).

### Reordering Groups

Organize groups in your preferred order:

1. In **Studio sidebar**, find the group
2. **Click and drag** the group
3. Drop in the desired position
4. Order is saved automatically

Groups appear in the same order in both menu bar and Studio.

### Deleting Groups

Remove groups you no longer need:

1. Select group in **Studio**
2. Right-click (or Control+click)
3. Choose **"Delete Group"**
4. Confirm deletion

**Important:**
- Deleting a group doesn't delete the lights
- Lights remain on the bridge and in other groups
- Can't delete the "All Lights" system group

## Hiding and Showing Groups

### Hiding Groups

Hide groups you rarely use to clean up your interface:

1. Right-click the group
2. Select **"Hide"** or **"Hide from List"**
3. Group disappears from menu bar and sidebar

Hidden groups:
- Still exist on your bridge
- Can be controlled if you navigate directly to them
- Can be unhidden anytime

### Showing Hidden Groups

Restore visibility to hidden groups:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Hidden Items** in Studio
2. Find the group in the list
3. Click **"Show"** or **"Unhide"**
4. Group reappears in your lists

## Group Scenes

Apply scenes to specific groups.

### Room-Specific Scenes

Many scenes are designed for specific rooms:
- Only affect lights in that room
- Appear when viewing the room
- Quick access to room-specific moods

### Applying Scenes to Groups

1. Select a group
2. Look for **"Scenes"** section in main area
3. Click any scene to apply to group
4. Only lights in both the scene and group are affected

See [Scenes documentation](/docs/features/scenes) for more details.

## Multi-Bridge Groups

If you have multiple bridges:

### Groups Are Bridge-Specific

- Each bridge has its own set of groups
- Groups can't span multiple bridges (Hue limitation)
- Switch bridges to see different groups

### Workaround for Multi-Bridge Groups

Create similar scenes on each bridge:
1. Create scene with same name on both bridges
2. Activate both scenes to control lights across bridges
3. Use [Shortcuts app](/docs/integration/shortcuts-app) to activate multiple scenes at once

## Advanced Group Features

### Group Status Indicators

Groups show helpful status information:

- **All On**: All lights in group are on
- **Some On**: Some lights on, some off (mixed state)
- **All Off**: All lights in group are off
- **Average Brightness**: Overall brightness level
- **Dominant Color**: Most common color in group

### Group Quick Actions

In Studio, groups may have quick actions:

- **All On**: Turn all lights on to last brightness
- **All Off**: Turn all lights off
- **Full Brightness**: Set all to 100%
- **Favorite Scene**: Quick-apply favorite scene to group
- **Copy State**: Copy group's current state

### Dynamic Groups

Some groups are dynamic:

- **All Lights**: Automatically includes every light
- **All Color Lights**: Only color-capable lights
- **All Plugs**: All smart plugs on bridge

These update automatically as you add/remove devices.

## Tips for Effective Group Organization

### Naming Best Practices

1. **Be specific**: "Kitchen Counter" not just "Kitchen"
2. **Use location**: "Upstairs Hall" vs "Downstairs Hall"
3. **Indicate purpose**: "Reading Area", "Dining Table"
4. **Avoid generic names**: Not "Group 1", "Zone A", etc.

### Organization Strategies

#### By Location (Most Common)
- Living Room
- Bedroom
- Kitchen
- Bathroom
- Hallway

#### By Function
- Work Lights
- Relaxation Lights
- Movie Watching
- Dinner Ambiance

#### By Floor/Area
- First Floor
- Second Floor
- Basement
- Outdoor

#### Hybrid Approach
- Combine strategies: "Kitchen - Island", "Bedroom - Reading"

### Group Size Recommendations

- **Small groups (2-4 lights)**: Very responsive, easy to manage
- **Medium groups (5-10 lights)**: Good balance, most rooms
- **Large groups (10+ lights)**: May have slight delay, use for convenience

### Hierarchy Recommendations

1. **Start with rooms**: Match your physical home layout
2. **Add zones**: For larger or multi-purpose rooms
3. **Create custom groups**: For special scenarios
4. **Use favorites**: Mark most-used groups

## Troubleshooting Groups

### Group Not Showing

**Problem**: Group exists but doesn't appear in We Love Lights

**Solutions**:
- Click **Refresh** in menu or Studio
- Check group isn't hidden (Settings → Hidden Items)
- Verify group has at least one light
- Ensure you're viewing correct bridge

### Can't Control Group

**Problem**: Group controls don't affect lights

**Solutions**:
- Check individual lights are responding
- Verify lights in group are powered on and reachable
- Try controlling lights individually first
- Refresh device list from bridge

### Group Changes Don't Sync

**Problem**: Changes made in Hue app don't appear in We Love Lights

**Solutions**:
- Wait a few seconds for auto-sync
- Manually refresh in We Love Lights
- Check bridge connection is stable
- Restart We Love Lights if sync seems stuck

### Mixed Colors in Group

**Problem**: Group shows inconsistent colors

**Solutions**:
- This is normal if lights were individually adjusted
- Use group color control to synchronize all lights
- Create and recall a scene for consistent group state
- Select all lights and apply same color
