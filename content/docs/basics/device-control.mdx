- Actions apply to all selected simultaneously
- Individual device types may have limitations

## Smart Plug Control

Control devices connected to smart plugs.

### Turning Plugs On and Off

Smart plugs have simple on/off control:

#### Menu Bar
1. Find your smart plug in the menu
2. Click to toggle on/off
3. Status shows current state

#### Studio

## Device Status and Information

View detailed information about your devices.

### Device Status Indicators

- **On/Off**: Current power state
- **Brightness**: Current brightness level
- **Color**: Current color setting
- **Reachable**: Whether device is responding
- **Battery**: Battery level for battery-powered devices

### Viewing Device Details

In Studio:
1. Select any device
2. Look for **"Device Info"** or **"Details"** section
3. See complete information:
   - Model number
   - Firmware version
   - Unique ID
   - Bridge assignment
   - Last seen/updated time

### Unreachable Devices

If a device shows as "unreachable":
- Device may be unplugged or out of range
- Try power cycling the device
- Check if device is too far from bridge
- See [troubleshooting guide](/docs/support/troubleshooting#device-not-responding)

## Advanced Device Control

### Transition Time

Control how quickly lights change:
- **Instant**: Immediate change (0 seconds)
- **Quick**: Fast transition (0.2-0.5 seconds)  
- **Smooth**: Default transition (1-2 seconds)
- **Slow**: Gradual fade (3-5 seconds)

Some interfaces let you set transition time:
1. Look for transition or speed setting
2. Adjust seconds or select preset
3. Applies to next command

### Alert/Blink Effect

Make a light flash to identify it:
1. Select the light
2. Right-click (or Control+click)
3. Choose **"Identify"** or **"Blink"**
4. Light flashes briefly

Useful for:
- Finding which physical light corresponds to device
- Testing if light is responding
- Getting attention in room

### Power-On Behavior

Some lights remember their state:
- **Last State**: Returns to previous settings when powered on
- **Default**: Goes to specific brightness/color
- **Off**: Stays off until manually turned on

Configure in device settings (if supported by your bridge).

## Device Organization

Keep your devices organized for easier control.

### Renaming Devices

Give devices clear, meaningful names:
1. Select device in Studio
2. Click the **name field**
3. Type new name
4. Press **Enter** to save

Good naming examples:
- "Reading Lamp" instead of "Hue Color Lamp 1"
- "Kitchen Counter" instead of "Lightstrip Plus 3"
- "Bedroom Main" instead of "Color Bulb A19"

### Assigning to Rooms

Put devices in appropriate rooms:
1. Select device in Studio
2. Look for **"Room"** or **"Group"** setting
3. Choose room from dropdown
4. Save changes

Devices can be in multiple zones but typically one primary room.

### Hiding Devices

Hide devices you rarely use:
1. Right-click device
2. Select **"Hide"**
3. Device disappears from lists

Unhide later from Settings → Hidden Items.

### Favorites

Mark frequently used devices:
1. Select or hover over device
2. Click **star icon** to favorite
3. Favorites appear at top of lists

## Tips for Effective Device Control

### Speed Tips

1. **Use scenes**: Faster than adjusting multiple devices
2. **Favorite frequently used**: Quick access to common lights
3. **Keyboard shortcuts**: Skip the mouse entirely
4. **Menu bar for quick tasks**: Faster than opening Studio
5. **Group similar lights**: Control multiple as one

### Organization Tips

1. **Clear naming**: Know what you're controlling instantly
2. **Logical grouping**: Group by function or location
3. **Hide unused**: Reduce clutter in interface
4. **Consistent naming**: Use same conventions throughout

### Workflow Tips

1. **Create scenes for moods**: Morning, evening, movie, work
2. **Use groups for areas**: Control whole spaces at once
3. **Automate with sensors**: Lights turn on/off automatically
4. **Remote access**: Control when away from home

## Troubleshooting Device Control

### Device Not Responding

**Problem**: Commands don't affect the device

**Solutions**:
- Check device is powered on
- Verify device is in range of bridge
- Try power cycling the device
- Check bridge connection
- Use "Identify" to see if device responds at all

### Color Not Accurate

**Problem**: Colors don't look as expected

**Solutions**:
- Remember: different bulb models have different color gamuts
- Try different color picker (CIE 1931 most accurate)
- Check bulb supports full color (not just white)
- Some colors are impossible for lights to produce exactly

### Delayed Response

**Problem**: Lights respond slowly to commands

**Solutions**:
- Check network connection quality
- Reduce distance between bridge and lights
- Avoid sending too many commands too quickly
- Use local connection instead of remote when possible

### Brightness Won't Change

**Problem**: Slider moves but brightness stays same

**Solutions**:
- Check light is actually on first
- Try turning off and on again
- Verify light supports dimming (not just on/off)
- Check if light is at minimum/maximum already
